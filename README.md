Create a base class to hold information about sporting teams on campus. It should not be possible to instantiate the class.
Include common characteristics such a primary coach and type of sport. Define properties, ToString() methods and a minimum of one virtual method.
The ToString() method should return the name of the sport and coach.

Select two types of sporting teams and define subclasses for them. These classes should inherit from a bast team class that you created in Exercise 1.
Include unique characteristics about the wport. For example, for a tennis team, the field location and/or the person to contact to restring rackets may be of interest.
Be sure to implement any virtual methods included in the base class. Provide ToString() methods in both subclasses that override the base class ToString().

Create a windows form application that tests your designs of the base team class and individual sporting team subclasses.
Instantiate objects of both teams when the program launches and then invoke methods and properties to retrieve and display data about both teams.

Define an interface for the sporting team related to budgeting. Any teams that implement the interface must provide details about how they are budgeted.
Implement the interface for both teams.
